abstract = "The convergence of the intrapair correlation energy for a localized internal orbital is investigated as the virtual subspace is enlarged. At variance with previous investigations of this kind, the virtual subspace is represented in atomic orbitals. This allows to define spatial relations between the orbitals involved. Typically, over 98% of the pair correlation energy is recovered by a small local basis set, consisting of the valence orbitals of the atoms with which the electron pair is associated. This opens the possibility of an efficient Cl procedure based on localized pairs."

abstract = "The first full implementation of the localized configuration interaction technique at the variational CI, CEPA-2 and variational CEPA levels is described. Timings are presented for a double-zeta plus polarization calculation on butadiene. The restriction of the correlation space to local basis functions results in a spectacular enhancement of the efficiency of the CI loop. The loss in the correlation energy is only a few percent; we argue that most of the loss is due to the exclusion of intramolecular basis set superposition artifacts."
